# The Tree Survey is my solo project that I developed for Coding Dojo.

ğŸŒ² This project is a Python with Flask application. Using HTML5, CSS3, Jinja2, and Bootstrap for the Front-end work.

ğŸŒ² Back-end work consist of Python3 and MySQL. I used Balsamiq wireframes to draw up the page layout concepts.

ğŸŒ² Project Description: The Arbor Day Foundation sends me a paper survey each year asking questions. I was thinking of creating a webpage for folks to enter trees they have counted around them.

* - Register and Login page (with validation)<br>
* - Welcome dashboard page for user they can see what they have entered. Edit & Delete links<br>
* - Add location where they are at and how many trees are in that location. (address will have validations, # of trees etc)<br>
* - Edit page pre-fills data to edit.<br>
* - Tree look up page<br>


ğŸŒ² Backlog:

- Tree look up page may have to go into the backlog. Iâ€™d like to do a search for a tree based on selections they make and it returns different options to view and find the tree. Â Or allowing the user to upload a photo and it returns a list of potential matches to view and choose from.

- Make another additional page that covers every question that is present on the paper version of the survey.

- Additional page for Tree companies doing work on planting more trees.

- Add page for Bird, butterfly, and wildlife conservation info.


ğŸŒ² New Programming Concept(s) I'm Planning to Learn: - Implement the Jinja2 "includes" into my html, and further work with Bootstrap (responsiveness).

## The requirements for the solo project that we had to meet are the following.
## Solo Project Proposal

ğŸ¥· It's time to start putting your bootcamp skills to something you want to share with the world!

ğŸ¥· Begin by coming up with an idea, either from the listed wireframes, or your own design.  Your project should NOT be related to a belt exam or a past full-stack assignment. Your project should advance yourself as a developer, and it can also:

    Relate to a passion or hobby of yours
    Solve or simplify a problem for yourself or somebody
    Perform common good for a community

The front-end/design of your project can be just as important as your back-end, make sure you allow yourself the time to focus on this as well.

You should then build up a feature list for what you would want to include in your presentation (Minimum Viable Product or MVP) and features that would be cool, but not crucial (product backlog).
